# Workation in the Alps

### Bugs

  - Photos in section gallery in the media query from 992px are not on one raw --> Solution: resize images in the media query.
  - Heading in section gallery is missing --> Solution: add heading in HTML and set to to hidden in css.
  - With small screens until width 339 the header overflows the main section --> add new media query and adapt the margin-top property for main.
  - Send request button in coworking and workshops sections were at the beginning a button element with an "a href" element inside, this was wrong --> Solution delete button element, add role to "a href" element and set it to button.

- __Unsolved Bugs__
  - None.

### Mistakes and Lessons Learned

At the beginning of the project were some mistakes done in setting the first css properties along the parent-descendent rule. I have learned to use different background colors for header, main, body and footer in the very first stage of the development to better understand how the different elements are working with the defined css properties. Another mistake at the beginning was the lack of structure as I didn't use Flexbox properties properly. I have learned during the project the importance of CSS structure.
